Problem: I record the start and finish times for a job in my calendar. However, my calendar does not tell me how long a calendar item is. If my job starts at 8pm and ends at 3:30am, then I have to work out in my head how long this is - at 3:30am this is not what I want to do.

Solution: A very simple application which allows you to calculate the timespan between a start time and end time from common lexical representations of 12-hour and 24-hour time formats. This also supports same as that used in Google Calendar (e.g. 1p, 9a for AM and PM respectively) as well as normal AM and PM affixes.
